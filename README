The PPdot_diagram_color.py will create a plot like PPdot_diagram_final.eps, reading the 
textfiles that were generated from the ATNF pulsar catalog (link: https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/). 

The plot shows the current pulsar population spin period vs spin period derivative. Two main distinct groups slow 
normal pulsars (isolated pulsars) and the bottom left group the recycled pulsars (mostly in binary systems). Different symbols
show different binary systems. 

How to use:

Make sure to have python installed

run
python PPdot_diagram_color.py
